#  ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript"

## **Overview**

This project is a simple website designed to explain the key differences between **Vanilla JavaScript** and **ReactJS**, focusing on their use in web development.

### What is **Vanilla JavaScript**?
- Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks.
- It gives full control over the DOM but requires more effort for complex UIs.
- Suitable for smaller projects or scenarios where performance and simplicity are critical.

### What is **React**?
- React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- It simplifies the creation of dynamic, interactive, and complex web applications.
- React is widely adopted because of its flexibility, component-based architecture, and active community.


This website provides an introductory comparison, highlighting the advantages of using React for modern web development.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML for structure.
  - CSS for styling (dark theme).
  - JavaScript (Vanilla) for basic interactivity.


## Why Choose React Over Vanilla JavaScript?
- **Efficiency**: Reactâ€™s Virtual DOM ensures better performance and faster updates.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for larger, more complex projects.
- **Reusability**: Write components once, reuse them everywhere.
- **Community Support**: Access to countless libraries, tools, and resources.
